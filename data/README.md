This directory contains the JSON files containing the geometric data of each
of the individual Johnson solids as well as a single JSON file that contains
all of them.

The geometric information was extracted from the [*.wrl* files][files] of the
solids on George W. Hart's [Virtual Polyhedra][vp] pages.
